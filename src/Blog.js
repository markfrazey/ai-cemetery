          The advancement of Artificial Intelligence has been a major technological
          breakthrough in recent years, with chatbots becoming increasingly popular
          in everyday life. However, as AI technology develops, so do the issues and
          problems that arise from its implementation as well. Our final project
          deliverable, Chatbot Cemetery, seeks to explore these issues by detailing
          major chatbots that have been shut down for various reasons. The website is
          inspired by Google Graveyard and aims to provide insight into the reasons
          behind the chatbots' shutdowns. We aim to make people more aware of the
          potential issues when working with AI.

          The motivation behind our Chatbot Cemetery project stems from the increasing
          popularity of chatbots and the challenges that arise with the implementation
          of AI technology. We recognized the need to educate people on the importance
          of using a diverse dataset in AI to eliminate biased results, which can
          ultimately discriminate against and harm certain groups. Our project aims
          to shed light on the reasons behind the shutdowns of major AI bots due to
          privacy, racism, misinformation, and safety issues. With Chatbot Cemetery,
          we hope to provide a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in the history
          and development of chatbots and the ethical considerations that come with AI
          technology. Our goal is to encourage people's interest in AI while also showing
          them the downfalls and risks they should be aware of. Ultimately, we hope that
          visitors to our website gain a deeper understanding of the issues that arise
          when working with AI technology and realize the importance of ethical implementation.

          For our final project deliverable, we constructed a website titled “Chatbot Cemetery.”
          Its purpose is to detail major chatbots that have been shut down due to various reasons,
          such as privacy, racism, misinformation, and safety concerns. The inspiration for the
          website came from Google Graveyard, which lists all of the Google products and services
          that have been shut down over time (Ogden, n.d.). Other than the blog page, our website
          has three major pages. First, the Home page features a timeline of ten chosen chatbots
          that have been shut down. The timeline is designed to resemble a graveyard, with each
          chatbot represented by a card that includes their name, lifespan, and a short epitaph.
          The purpose of the Home page is to provide a quick overview of the chatbots that have
          been shut down and their reasons for being decommissioned. Next, on the Cemetery page,
          users can see a comprehensive list of all the dead chatbots. The page also offers
          filtering options based on various attributes, such as the chatbot's creator, the year
          it was active, or the reason for its shutdown. This page allows users to explore the chatbots
          in more detail and gain a deeper understanding of the reasons behind their shutdown. Finally,
          the About page provides context for the project and introduces the team members who
          worked on it. This page sheds light on the scope of the project and its goals, as well
          as the people who dedicated their time and effort to make the project a reality. It adds
          a personal touch to the website and helps users connect with the creators behind the project.

          From all that we have done, our intended impact of the project is to educate anyone
          interested in exploring AI on the concept of “garbage in, garbage out” and how
          algorithms that are trained on biased data will produce biased results. We
          believe a good way to put it is; “garbage” is a broad and expanding category
          in data science – poorly labeled or inaccurate data, data that reflects underlying
          human prejudices, incomplete data” (S&P Global, 2019). The “garbage” found in these
          datasets can ultimately discriminate against and hurt certain groups. We aspire to
          encourage people’s interest in AI while also showing them the downfalls of AI that
          they should be aware of. We want people to improve from the past errors in AI to
          understand and eliminate biased results and prevent any further issues with AI models.
          However, what we at least expect for the actual impact is to give people a more thorough
          understanding of why several of the models have failed and become more aware of this
          ongoing issue. Even though our expectations on the purpose of this project are promising,
          it will not fully achieve the full intended impact that we hoped for since biased data
          originally comes from the personal opinions and judgments of different people. As Raquel
          Magalhães writes, “Humans are inherently biased, even if that bias is implicit or
          unconscious… existing biases in society do tend to affect the way we speak, which in
          turn impacts the way we write, and what we write can eventually make its way into a
          machine learning datasets”(Magalhães, 2022). For us, this means that handling every
          single type of bias will be very difficult to analyze one at a time, due to the abundance
          of bias that exists in society and on the internet. Either way, it might be impossible to
          eliminate bias entirely, but we believe this knowledge will make people more aware of
          the potential issues when working with AI and make them more informed consumers
          of chatbots. If all goes well, the status of the project will expand upon this
          in the future with information on current AIs in progress for users to analyze.

          Overall, our website serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in the
          history and development of chatbots. We aim to provide insight into the reasons
          behind their shutdowns and help users gain a better understanding of the issues
          that arise when working with AI technology, and we hope that after exploring our
          website, people begin to understand the importance of ethical implementation and
          realize the many harms that can come with the benefits of technological advances.
