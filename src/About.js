      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Chatbot Cemetery, a website dedicated to exploring the rise and fall of chatbots over the past six years.</p>
      <p>As the popularity of chatbots grew, so did the number of bots created. However, not all chatbots were successful and many were shut down due to various reasons.</p>
      <p>Through our website, we aim to provide insight into why certain chatbots failed, whether it was due to lack of user engagement, technological limitations, or ethical concerns.</p>
